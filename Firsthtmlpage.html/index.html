		<h1>IT WAS ALREADY THE PLAN</h1>
		<p> As an African American, we fear being pulled over by a police officer as we don't know the outcome after. To many unforgiving deaths, families ruined and stories all around the world, all telling the same thing: They don't care about us. This comic book is not just a creation of fancy pictures and artwork but, a message and a story of how an African American is not targeted as an individual, but target as a whole. It may not be much but, the message is what holds the quantity. </p>
